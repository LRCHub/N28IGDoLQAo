Baby baby, baby baby, baby baby, baby baby, baby baby,

I wanna roll inside your soul
to know the things that you need and feel
everytime that you're by my side
I can't get serious, because you got me

Cold chill down on my spine
no no more tears, show me a smile
cold chill down on my spine
no no more tears, show me a smile

Baby baby, why can't we just stay together, yeh yeh yeh
baby baby, why can't we just stay together, yeh yeh yeh
baby baby, why can't we just stay together, yeh yeh yeh
baby baby, why can't we just stay together, yeh yeh yeh

Deep inside I know you need it
just let it out and get it on, you gotta feel it
every time that you're by my side
just think it over, I'll make you glad

Cold chill down on my spine
no no more tears, show me a smile
cold chill down on my spine
no no more tears, show me a smile

Baby baby, why can't we just stay together, yeh yeh yeh
baby baby, why can't we just stay together, yeh yeh yeh

baby baby
baby baby
Baby baby baby baby baby

Cold chill down on my spine
no no more tears, show me a smile
cold chill down on my spine
no no more tears, show me a smile

Baby baby, why can't we just stay together, yeh yeh yeh
baby baby, why can't we just stay together, yeh yeh yeh
Baby baby, why can't we just stay together, yeh yeh yeh
baby baby, why can't we just stay together, yeh yeh yeh

baby baby x11
why can't we just stay together, yeh yeh yeh
